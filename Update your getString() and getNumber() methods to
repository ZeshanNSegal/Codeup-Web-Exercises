Update your getString() and getNumber() methods to each take two optional parameters: $min and $max. Update your methods in the following manner:

If $key is not a string, or $min & $max are not numbers, throw an InvalidArgumentException.
If the requested key is missing from the input, throw an OutOfRangeException
If the value is the wrong type, throw a DomainException
If a string is shorter than $min or longer than $max, throw a LengthException
If a number is less than $min or larger than $max, throw a RangeException
Update national_parks.php to take advantage of your $min and $max values to validate user input.

Catch the correct exception types and push appropriate error messages onto your $errors array.

Bonus

Create a custom DateRangeException.

Add $min and $max to the getDate() method; they should both be instances of DateTime. If the inputed date is outside of the specified range, throw your DateRangeException.

//min and max range for numbers. min should be zero
//outofrange
//valid type= domain exception
//sting length exception
//range exception
