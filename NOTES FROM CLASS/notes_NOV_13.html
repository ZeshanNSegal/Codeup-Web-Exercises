Models are used to represent data. 
File parsing excercise... the model would be the array mirrored in the data set. 
Controller ties and manages logic, end goals, it does the "thinking" for how things should work. 
View is how we present the info to the user. 
Page controller function- returns an array of data. It's the data we want presented in on the page. 

<?php date_default_timezone_set('America/Chicago'); ?>

<?php 
Page Controller needs to return an array with the values we want to use in the code below it. 

function pageController()
{
	//do all the necessary buisness logic for my page

	//call whatever other functions are needed(run the code)
$hour = date('G');
$google = google.com;
	

}
page controller returns an array and we use this data in our code below. 


$data = pageController();

// extract function- new function
extract($data)
// - takes the array from $pageController and turns into 

if($hour < 12): ?>
	<h3>Good Morning!</h3>
<?php if($hour < 18): ?>

query strings are key => value pairs
part of an associative array 
seperator between multiple key => value pairs is the '&' symbol
Default method is a get request if you don't put it on your form. 

var_dump($_GET) is an array in PHP we can do the same things with this that we do with anything else in PHP. 
/////////////////////////////////

$personName= 'Hampton';

if(isset($_GET['person_name'])) {
($personName = $_GET['person_name]);
}

ternary version of example above: 
$personName = isset($_GET['person_name']) ? $_GET['person_name] : 'Hampton' ;

$xxxxx = variable equals condition ? if condition is met do this part before question mark : if not set then use Hampton as default. 
/////////////////////////////////

GET good for retrieving from the server
POST intended for modifying and changing stuff on the server
