	<h3>Some People in Hampton are:</h3>

	<ul>
		<?php foreach($names as $person) { ?>
			<li><?php echo $person; ?></li>
			<?php } ?>
	</ul>
</body>
</html>



don't use r+, w+, a+-- instead have two handles a $handle ($inputfile, 'r') and another $handle($inputfile, 'a')--- does the same thing but opens two versions. One for reading and one for writing. 

$lines = explode(PHP_EOL, trim($contents)); explode and trim at the same time. 

PHP code can't be seen in the inspect element/console. 

If you have php code you want to be seen on screen, you must put it in <?php echo $message?> tags. 

Most of PHP code will go above <!DOCTYPE html> include files, declare classes, outside of html. Only thing that belongs in html tags is where you are actually echoing out data. 

Keep most out of HTML to make it easier on yourself. 
Keep HTML outside of PHP, as much as possible. Keep strings clean and short. 
example of best practice:
 <h2 class= "heading-two center" id="my-second-heading"><?php echo $message; ?>
</h2>
versus:	<?php echo"<h2 class="heading-two-center" id="my-second-heading">$message</h2>"; ?>

First one is cleaner, and easier to read. Also gives HTML highlights properly.
