<!-- // ////// For-Each Loop below is the same as the above. It runs for each element in that array before each loop runs a specific function

//Objects are a grouping of data and functionality. Everything in JS are objects. Have a key-value index. Key gets a value. 
// access the kkey with a '.' (a period). ex. colors.length length is a property of colors. color is the key. Length is the value. 
//console.log is a key-value. Console is the key log is the function(value).
// use {} to make an empty object. 

// built in variable 'this' to call the object in the variable -->


JavaScrip Objective Notation(JSON) is a data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. It is widely used in cloud based services and web application programming interfaces (APIs).

Object literal and array literal notations were discussed earlier, and these same notations are used in JSON. 

<!-- Empty object in json form looks like this : --> {}

<!-- empty array in json form looks like this --> []

Object properties in JSON start with a string version of the property name, followed by the value of the property. Properties are seperated by a comma. 

<!-- Example: --> {
	"name1": "value1",
	"name2": "value2"
}

The value of a property can be one of the following: 
	- A quoted string
	- A number
	- An object
	- An array
	- true or false
	- null

 <!-- Example utilizing all the possible types: -->
 {
 	"stringProp": "stringValue",
 	"numberProp": 1,
 	"objectProp": {
 		"prop": "value"
 	},
 	"arrayProp" : ['item1', 'item2'],
 	"arrayOfObjectsProp" : [
 		{
 			"prop": "value"
 		},
 		{
 			"prop": "value"
 		}	
 	],
 	"boolProp"  : true,
 	"nullProp"  : null
}

Be seeing and using JSON syntax over the next few months. Need to study. 

Objects don't have any inherant order to them in JSON
