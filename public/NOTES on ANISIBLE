NOTES on ANISIBLE
Playbooks- create tasks, to help manage servers easily. 
We have used anisible already. Ansible set up everything in our vagrant box on Day 1. 
Vagrant-lamp -> Ansible File->Playbooks File(all custom built for us to be used on our servers)
vagrant, production, and warpspeed, and deploy files all have playbooks. 
Run playbooks from the command line
