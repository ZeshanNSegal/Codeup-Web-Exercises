		<h2 class="h2">Hello from Zee!</h2>
		<p class="h1">This is a review, but I need to get the basics down. It's like the first layer of the house. Build it strong, and then, the rest of the house will be structrally sound.</p>

		<div id="container">	
			<p>Once you get the basics, once you understand them... the rest starts to come in natrually. So, what are the things I need to learn? For starters, HTML and CSS. </p>

		<!-- actual page content goes here -->

		<!-- or they can be
		multi

			<p>A div is a block level element.</p>
		</div> 
			<!-- A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."  They also begin on new lines. Generally, block-level elements may contain data, other block-level elements, or inline elements. 

			These are all divs (but there are more): address, article, aside, audio, blockquote, canvas, div, dd, dl, fieldset, figcaption, figure, footer, form, h1 - h6, header, hr, li, main, nav, ol, p, pre, section, table, ul, video-->

		<p>"Em" and "strong" are the "inline elements" in the code "Inline". It is surrounded by the "emphasis"  and "strong" tags you see next... <em>inline</em> <strong>element.</strong></p>
			<!-- An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element. Inline elements do not begin with a new line. Generally, inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements. 
			These are all inline elements (but, again, more) : a, abbr, cite, code, em, q, span, script, sub, sup, strong, button, input, label, select, textarear, img, object, map-->

			<!-- Some HTML elements, are defined as "void elements". This simply means that they are not meant to contain any content. Since there is no content, a closing tag is not needed and therefore a void element looks like this: -->

		<div id="wrapper">
			<p>Right now, I am sitting in <span style="color:red">BookPeople</span>, the bookstore. I am in the cafe. People are speaking loudly. I have my earphones in. I am reviewing the curriculum. It's starting to make more sense. I think more than anything, the speed of the class is hard for me to keep up with.<p/>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph1">
			<p>What does the <br>span tag<br> do?<br> I just learned by googling! Span is an inline element used with another compontent. On it's own, it's unseen, but add an id and element, and it does something! Is this a correct interpretaion of the span tag?</p>

			<p>Questions I have:</p>
