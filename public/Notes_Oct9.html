Methods are functions that live on an object
Math Objects are dynamic. 
Math.random returns a floating point number between 0 and 1... So Math.random  * 100 gives a number between 0 and 100. 
MAth.round up or down to the nearest int. 20.5 rounds up to 21, 20.49 rounds down to 20. Math.floor always rounds down. 4.95 rounds to 4. 
Math.pow(2, 16) first # is base, second is exponet so 2 to the 16th power.. 
Math.sqrt(9) = 3 no sqrts of neg. numbers. 
BOM= Browser Object Model -- interface between web browser and JS allowing one progrma to talk to another. 
Browser existed before JS. 
Access to alerts, prompts, web address bar, the page, hyperlinks. JS talking to the browser. 
Window object is the core of the BOM, and it represents an instance of the web browser. Thru the window obj. we can control the browsers size, position, open pop-up windows, display system dialogs, or run interval based processing. The window obj. represents the JS Global object. This means that any variables or functions declared in the global scope become part of the window object. 
Interval and timeouts are executed code either at a set interval  of time or after a certain time interval has passed....
setInterval() allows code to be executed at a specific time interval. 
setInterval accepts delays in milliseconds. 
Intervals in real-world example... Bank account asks if you are still there... netflix asks if you are still watching, videogames send new enemies at different interrvals. 
Intervalic loop with a delay is what an interval is. 
Loops with delay. 
setTimeout() is like an egg timer. sets a delay like a time bomb... when it's done with the timeout then, and only then can it run its function. 

Redirect Browser with back and forward to make websites go back a page, or forward one page or to a new website. 

DOM- Document Object Modelgetting funtions to locate the objects you want to locate... similar to id and class locaters

Id- document.get.elementById()
class- document.getElementsByClassName()
tags... document.getElementsByTagName()
get elements by tag names... like divs  or h1 or h2, etc.. or paragraph tags or in the example... grabbing by list items. 
ex. var listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');

Direct Accessto Form Inputs
forms are accessible by name via the forms collection
var usernameInput = document.forms.login.username;
console.log(usernameInput.value);

Accessing or Modifying Inner HTML and text
inner HTML
mainHeading.innerHTML = "Hello Codeup!";
console.log(mainHeading.innerHTML);s

Listener is a fucntion looking out for events... keyup, mouse click, change- inut loses focus after it's been modified, submit form is submitted
